# Gatsby blog starter project

This is a sample blog starter project to test your ability to learn new skills and apply your existing skills to a Gatsby project.

## What you need to do

We need you to take this sample project and add some extra features and completely overhaul the visual layout and design of the project to match this design: https://xd.adobe.com/view/bf79f426-9e97-4e02-a1ff-1cc7f34ed338-ea2a/.

## Key goals and deliverables

- Implementing pagination for the index page of the blog as seen in the design (Pages will need to be generated in `gatsby-node.js`)
- Matching the design exactly on desktop.
- Making use of [gatbsy-plugin-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image) for images that appear on the index page as well as the hero image on the actual blog post page.
- The project will have to be responsive and work well on mobile.
- We will be assessing your final solution by building the project using `yarn build` and `yarn serve` so make sure your project can be built without any errors.

## Dependencies and tools

- You may install any depandencies or tools that may be required.

## Submission

In order to submit this assignment you will need clone this project and then [push the repo](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45196631/how-to-upload-a-cloned-git-repository-to-an-own-git-repository-on-github) to your own GitHub account. When you are done, submit a link of your public repo to work@teamgeek.io (Please do not create a pull-request).

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd blog-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
